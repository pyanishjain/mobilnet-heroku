check flask app wtih heroku
hsoted : https://trashflask.herokuapp.com/

here i am using keras mobilnet how to host deep learning model in hroku ,
as heroku has limit of 500Mb

please check requirement.txt file to get dependenies
it takes about 420MB / 500MB of disk space

i try with fastai but takes about 890MB of diskspace hence it is not possibel to host fastai model with heroku
